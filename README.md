The content and format of the report is up to you, but it should help the decision maker (stakeholder) figure out whether he/she is ready to “ship” the product, whether it needs more fixes, what to invest in next, and so on. 

Ideally, the report would also include how you decided what to test and how you spent your testing time.


For example, your report would start by describing the state of the SUT, then might include what you felt was the most important to test; then you might include a few details on your strategy and which major issues you found.

Please adhere to the timeline, otherwise, your test will not be considered for further process. 
Good Luck!
